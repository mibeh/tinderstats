# TinderStats

This script can be used to gather some statistics on your Tinder profile. 

To obtain a copy of the data Tinder has for your profile, first navigate to https://policies.tinder.com/privacy/intl/en#your-rights and follow the link to request a copy of your data. Be advised that it may take up to 7-10 days for the data to be delivered to the email address provided.

After you receive the data from your Tinder account, download the attached `myData.zip`. 

This script is expecting a `data.json` in the same directory it is run from.

How to run:
`$ python3 tinderstats.py`
